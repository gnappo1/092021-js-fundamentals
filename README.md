# Introduction to JavaScript

## History of JavaScript

* Early Days
  * Created by Brendan Eich at Netscape in 10 days in 1995
  * Was not a highly respected programming language for about 10 years
  * Based on functional languages with some object-oriented patterns, is a multi-paradigm language
  * Applications like Google Maps and Gmail were where JavaScript gained popularity
* Standards
  * The standard for JavaScript implementations is called ECMAScript
  * Given that there are several **competing** JavaScript engines, the [European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecma_International) is responsible for standardizing JavaScript, referred to as [ECMAScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript)
  * The standard is updated yearly and the standard for that year is called ECMAScript 20xx (or ES 20xx); ES2015 or ES6.
  * [Browser Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars) still leave us with legacy JavaScript implementations (and weirdness)
  * We can use transpiling to write JavaScript according to the standard we want and convert it to code that can be used for the majority of JavaScript applications

### Review Request-Response Cycle

![HTTP request response cycle from : https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/using-google-app/9780596802462/ch01.html](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/using-google-app/9780596802462/httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages295368.png)

* Request-Response lifecycle
  * Request is made to a server
  * We get a response back with data in binary, text, HTML, or JSON
  * We use that data in our application
* In the browser
  * A user enters an address in the address bar (or clicks a link)
  * A request is made to a server, which typically serves HTML
  * Included in that HTML are links to images, fonts, stylesheets, and scripts
  * Each one of those links means another request by the browser but without refreshing the page
  * When all the external links have loaded, the page itself is finished loading
* Loaded JavaScript
  * JavaScript can be written directly in HTML through a `script` tag
  * It can also be loaded externally through a `script` tag with a `src` attribute
  * When the browser sees JavaScript, it attempts to run it immediately
* JavaScript implementations
  * Each browser has its own [JavaScript engine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_engine) or implementation
  * The [Document Object Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model) is the interface between the loaded HTML and the JavaScript code we write
  * Most browsers are converging on agreeing on web standards, but browsers need the ability to add proprietary features to CSS, JS, and the DOM (I'm looking at you Internet Explorer ðŸ˜¡)

## Documentation

- **PLEASE ALSO BURN THIS INTO YOUR MEMORY**. Always start with [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) when looking at JS documentation. W3 Schools is great for HTML and CSS, **NOT SO MUCH FOR JAVASCRIPT**.

(all hail Mozilla)

- **INDENTATION AND PROPER STYLE ARE ALSO SUPER IMPORTANT MOVING FORWARD**. Airbnb has an amazing [JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) if you're unsure about how to format your JS code. Trust me, learn to indent properly now before you end up in a curly bracket nightmare.

## Todays Agenda

* DataTypes
* Variables
* Parameters, Arguments, Default Arguments
* Return
* Scope
* Context
* Hoisting

### Variables

3 different kinds of variables

```js
var - not safe, gets hoisted, can be redeclared, can be reassigned
let - safe, does get hoisted but is in the temporal dead zone (TDZ), cannot be redeclared, can be reassigned
const - safe, does get hoisted but is in the temporal dead zone (TDZ), cannot be redeclared, cannot be reassigned
```

### Hoisting

Javascript runs a file 2 seperate times, 1 to define everything and hoist. A second time to execute code.

Hoisting means to bring declaration to the top of the file in order for everything to be defined.

For exmaple:

```js

var greeting = "hello"

```

would be hoisted to:

```js
var greeting;

greeting = "hello"
```

Hoisting can be dangerous due to variables being used before given values, there is no errors for using a variable before giving it a value therefore makes debugging harder.

### Functions

Functions in javascript are like methods in ruby. They serve the same purpose. There are a few different ways to define functions.

```js
function greeting() {
  console.log('hello world');
}
```

This way of defining functions get hoisted to the top of the page and is usable anywhere in your code.

Function definitions are also values and can be assigned to variables as well.

```js

const greeting = function() {
  console.log('hello world');
}

```

Declaring a const to a function will obey the same laws that any other const obeys. This function will not be hoisted, you won't be able to redeclare greeting or reassign greeting as well.

Then we have the arrow function.

```js

const greeting = () => {
  console.log('hello world');
  return 1+1; // with the {} code block attached to the => arrow function you must use the return keyword in order to return a value.
}

// and

const impliedReturnOfSum = (num1, num2) => num1 + num2;

with no {} and simple logic, you can use an implied return. In this example this function will automatically return num1 + num2;

impliedReturnOfSum(1, 3) // returns 4

```

You can also give default values:

```js
function greeting(name = "developer") {
  console.log(`hello ${name}`) // take note that ` is the only string syntax we can interpolate with ${}
}

greeting("Bob") // logs hello Bob
greeting() // logs hello developer
```

### DataTypes

Here is a list of some of the different datatypes in JS:

```js
Primitive Datatypes:
  1. Number
  2. String
  3. Undefined
  4. Symbol
  5. Null
  6. Boolean
  7. BigInt

Object Datatypes:
  1. Function
  2. Object
  3. Array
```

### Return

You must explicitly use `return` in a function unless it's an arrow funtion without a code block {}. If no `return` is given, the function will automatically give back `undefined`.
